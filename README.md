# Wareya's OpenMW Post-Processing Shaders

Follower AA: A very accurate AA shader that looks almost as good as MSAA on large objects. Should be very close to the bottom of your shader order. Does not blur the screen. Works by following edges and predicting how much aliasing there is. Can read from depth, normal map, or color when walking edges. Has an option to disable itself in places where it thinks MSAA is rendering; you can use it too smooth out jaggies on other post processing effects even with MSAA enabled. That option is subject to this OpenMW bug: https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7203

water: A post-processing water shader with screen-space reflections. Currently VERY experimental, and requires editing the built-in water shader. Subject to this OpenMW bug: https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7202 **THIS WATER SHADER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OUTDATED CORE SHADER MODS. DO NOT ASK ANYONE FOR HELP IF YOU TRY TO USE IT WITH OUTDATED CORE SHADER MODS.**

waterblur: A blur-based effect designed to hide specular fireflies on water.

war_adjustments: A contrast, brightness, saturation, color temperature, tint, gamma, etc. adjustments shader.

BadCRT: A really bad scanlines and chroma fringing effect.

zoom, zoom_smooth: Zoom in the center of the screen. Mainly for debugging, but if you're OK with the blurriness, you can use zoom_smooth to hide the screen-edge artifacts of screenspace reflections.

# Using the water shader

**ＷＡＲＮＩＮＧ:** The water shader is currently experimental. OpenMW doesn't expose enough for water shaders to work 100% right.

**THIS WATER SHADER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OUTDATED CORE SHADER MODS. DO NOT ASK ANYONE FOR HELP IF YOU TRY TO USE IT WITH OUTDATED CORE SHADER MODS.**

To use the water shader, find and open `water.frag` and, below this line:

`gl_FragData[0] = applyFogAtDist(gl_FragData[0], radialDepth, linearDepth);`

Add this new line:

`gl_FragData[0].w = 0.0;`

Then, in the ingame video options for water, set the settings like this:

(The ripple density can be set to anything you want, but "Simple" ripples won't render.)

Then, enable post-processing, open the post-processing settings, and add the water shader below ssao (if you have it) but above everything else. The water shader is not 100% compatible with cloud and volumetric fog shaders; you'll need to move them around a bit and decide which order looks better.
